# tensorflow_image_classification_GUI_software
Tensorflow Image Classification Project
An image classifier software using google's inception model in tensorflow, openCV and python's tkinter GUI capabilities.
Involves a lot of multi-threadng and resource control as well as server reads/writes


Quote from Quora:
Classification is the process of categorizing a stimuli into a finite set of classes or labels. The process normally involves recognition of the dominant content in a scene. The dominant content gets the strongest confidence score irrespective of the transformation of that content such as scaling, location or rotation.
An example of a classification problem is when given an image of a dog or anything else, we want to know what dominant content is there. Thus a classification system should always label that image as “dog” no matter where the dog is in the image so long as the dog is the dominant content there. If the dog is no longer the dominant content, the system should change the label of the image to the next dominant content. Sometimes it is possible to get labels with comparable confidence scores thus sometimes a winner take all approach may not be the best approach, instead we can use a k-winners take all approach instead.
Thus all you need to know is that classification involves invariant recognition of the image content. In simple terms classification is concerned about what is in the scene and not where it is.
